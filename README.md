# Quest System

## Quest Components

### Task
Quests can have a list of tasks which are required to be completed before the quest can be finished (e.g. User needs to login 5x).
A quest can have multiple tasks. The boolean operators ``AND`` and ``OR`` can be used to combine tasks. These operators can also be nested (e.g. User needs to login 5x OR The Sun is shining).
